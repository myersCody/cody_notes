1. Introduction
    1. Hello Everyone
    2. Today
    3. Gonna Start with changes
        - 90 day graphs
    4. Then
    5. Finally
    6. AWS Saving plan Transition
2. AWS Saving Plans
**Settings**
   1. Navigate to the settings & bottom of the page
   2. This drop down shows the 3 options for calculating upfront costs
   3. Keep amortized & for more info see doc
   4. Now that we covered the default cost option lets take a look at our overview page
**Overview**
   1. From here I can see all of my openshift costs.
   2. Switch to AWS
   3. Dropdown
   4. Which is reflected in the graphs below showing both current and predictive data.
   5. If we switch our cost type the page will be updated to reflect the new cost type.
   6. For example, notice how when we switch from Amortized where the recurrring and/or upfront costs are distributed evenly accross the entire month to blended our cost will go up.
   7. That is because the upfront costs are no longer being distributed evenly throughout the month.
   8. We can also see the AWS cost type distinction in the Cost Explorer
**Cost Explorer**
   1. New cost explorer, create custom graphs
   2. Amazon Service example
   3. Now this third dropdown should look familiar at this point. I think these graphs can really help understand the difference in the cost views.
    - For example, if we look **Amortized** view notice how the services look consistent each day. However, you can see more fluxuation when I switch the view over to unblended.
   4. This becomes even more apparent when we switch over to using to using the 90 day graphs.
   5. The 90 day graphs were added this year, but by extending the range of the graphs our customerr now have a better insight into how their cost fluxuates on the day to day.
